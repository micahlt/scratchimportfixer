# Scratch Import Fixer
SVG files created with Affinity Designer don't import correctly in the Scratch editor.  This web app fixes that.

## Limitations
Due to technical limitations, this web app may not work for truly huge SVGs.  If your file is over 20MB, you could experience issues.  To fix larger files, check out the [Windows Electron app](https://github.com/micahlt/sif-windows/releases).
